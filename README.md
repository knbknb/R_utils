#### Some utility functions that are useful for learning purposes

No longer *that* useful, because now I'd use `tidyverse` functions for most tasks.

#### Deprecated


Forked from Brendan O'Connor's github repo [dlanalysis][2], Feb 2013.

##### util.R contains utilities for R that might be useful.

##### Organized in the following way:

From Question [How to organize large R programs?][1] on Stackoverflow.com:

>I like putting different functionality in their own files.

>R's package system is rather hard to use.

>A lightweight alternative: to place a file's functions inside an environment (what every other language calls a "namespace") and attach it. For example, I made an `'util'` group of functions like so:

       util = new.env()
     
       util$bgrep = function [...]
     
       util$timeit = function [...]
     
       while("util" %in% search())
  
            detach("util")
       
       attach(util)
  
>This is all in a file `util.R`. When you `source()` it, you get the environment '`util`' so you can call `util$bgrep()` and such; but furthermore, the `attach()` call makes it so just `bgrep()` and such work directly. If you didn't put all those functions in their own environment, they'd pollute the interpreter's top-level namespace (the one that ls() shows).
